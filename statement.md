# Project Statement – Hostel Room Allocation System

## Problem Statement
Managing hostel room allocation manually becomes difficult when the number of students increases. Issues such as duplicate entries, room conflicts, and incorrect record keeping often occur.  
To solve this, we need a simple and efficient program that can store student details, allocate rooms, check available rooms, remove students, and display all room allocations.
The goal of this project is to build a console-based Hostel Room Allocation System using Python that automates the process of maintaining room records and student assignments.

## Scope of the Project
- The system allows adding new students with their name and roll number.
- It maintains a list of hostel rooms and their current occupants.
- Rooms can be allocated to any student who is not yet assigned.
- The system prevents:
  - Allocating already occupied rooms  
  - Adding duplicate students  
  - Assigning rooms to non-existing students
- Students can be removed, and their room will become available again.
- Users can view:
  - All room allocations  
  - All available rooms  
- The project is fully menu-driven and runs in the terminal.
